                     - BootstrapJS 4.1.3 -> 5.1.3 (I tried updating the css, but it would break the whole thing)

                Authors note: There are a few Skill stats for Chii missing but this time I made a list.
                              If there are any bugs, errors or typos let me know. Next update I'll add descriptions to Ephnel.

                             for each skill, but it might take a while since I only play stella regularly.
