               Authors note: I'm slowly trying to add all Character Descriptions and stats 
                             for each skill, but it might take a while since I only play stella regularly.
                             If anybody likes to help out, Add/Message me on Discord (Eden~â™¡#2724), that's where I respond the quickest
